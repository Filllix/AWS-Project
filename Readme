🌐 Static Website Hosting using Amazon S3

https://github.com/Filllix/AWS-Project/blob/main/Deploy%20Simple%20Website%20Using%20S3.pdf

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple static website using Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting.
The website is publicly accessible through an S3 endpoint without using CloudFront or Route 53, making it suitable for AWS beginner and restricted environments such as AWS VocLab / AWS re:Start.

🚀 Deployment Steps
1️⃣ Create S3 Bucket

Bucket name must be globally unique

Region: any (example: ap-southeast-1)

Disable Block all public access

2️⃣ Upload Website Files

Upload the following files to the S3 bucket:

index.html

error.html

assets/ (if any)
         
3️⃣ Enable Static Website Hosting

Go to Bucket → Properties

Enable Static website hosting

Set:

Index document: index.html

Error document: error.html
         
4️⃣ Configure Bucket Policy

Apply a bucket policy to allow public access:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}


⚠️ Replace your-bucket-name with your actual bucket name.
         5️⃣ Access Website

Use the Static Website Endpoint provided by Amazon S3:

http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com
